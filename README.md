# Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-CNN
The project "Lung Cancer Detection Using CNN" focuses on developing a deep learning-based approach for early and accurate detection of lung cancer using medical imaging data such as CT scans or X-rays. Early detection is critical for improving survival rates and treatment outcomes.
We collected data from Kaggle The dataset contains  CT-scan of 
NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER
*Adenocarcinoma
*Large cell carcinoma
*Squamous cell carcinoma
